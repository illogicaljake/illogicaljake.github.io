# What I do

Most of my time has been in the ad agency world. That means I've adapted to quite a variety of systems. Some were more dated
than others, not every ad agency is managing to catch up with the digital world. 

I've also helped establish development processes where they hadn't previously existed, build code standards for efficiency and productivity, 
and work directly with other departments to make some kick-ass experiences.

In addition to my full-time employers listed below, I've worked a slew of contracts and short-term gigs. This 
includes months of work for __Martin Williams__, __Miller Brooks__, and a few start-ups.

Clients include __Scotts LawnService__, __Buffalo Wild Wings__, __Brachs Candy Company__, __Ameriprise__, and several
others I can't mention due to pesky non-disclosures.
