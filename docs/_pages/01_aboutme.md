# Who I am

I get it, __Jake Hamilton__'s a really common American name. If you tried to search for me, you're more likely to find things related
to the musical. So, this site represents _this_ Jake Hamilton, the web developer from Minnesota.

_This_ Jake Hamilton has been working in development for eight years now, with most of that time focused on
the frontend web. 

(Between you and me, I went through college expecting to be a designer, but gained experience on both sides. 
I eventually found that bringing designs to life is _way_ more interesting. But this means I have valuable experience in Photoshop,
Sketch, and a handful of other design tools.)

## My Philosophy
### It's all about the user

In life, there's always twists and turns and challenges to face. It takes motivation to conquer them. Motivation comes from
strong thinking. As Maya Angelou once said, "If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude."

With development, I'm a strong advocate pushing for meaningful user interaction and accessibility. It's easy to
target the majority and forget about the few. But, with eCommerce, it can make or break a business.

## My Story
### Yesterday

While attending college at Indiana University's Indianapolis campus, I started to dive headfirst into this "new media"
world by working as an intern at a social media marketing agency. That group became my family, I was hired full time, and
things have only gotten more awesome.

I moved on to the advertising world after a while â€“ I worked contract and full-time at a handful of agencies over the next
five years. It's been a blast. I've met awesome people and gained a ton of experience faster than I could've in any
other setting. I fell in love with putting out fires, solving problems, and contributing to a larger goal.

### Today

I've built a ton of awesome sites, and want to put that experience to use on a spectacular frontend web development team. 
My ideal team loves what they're doing and always keeps the end user in mind.

I've spent my own time analyzing client Google Analytics data to propose new ways to influence user actions. I've built
modules and widgets that solve common problems. But the best part is always bringing life to a great user experience.

### Tomorrow

There are still so many areas of the web I'd like to learn more about. I've got some experience in Vue.js but I'm itching
to build more with it. I'm always going to keep building my understanding of web accessibility and being a proponent for standards 
on every project I touch.
